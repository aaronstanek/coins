    <p>
        This calculator estimates the value of spare change by weight.

    <h3>
        Manual Sample
    </h3>
    <p>
        Using the manual sample option, the operation is fairly straightforward.
        The user-provided sample tells the calculator about the ratios of each
        denomination of coin. The calculator already knows the weight of each denomination
        of coin. So it can then compute the value of the sample by summing the values of
        all the user-specified coins, and it can compute the weight of the sample by summing
        together the weight of the user-specified coins. Dividing these gives the value per gram.
        Then it just multiplies this by the number of grams in the whole jar to estimate the value.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Automatic Sample
    </h3>
    <p>
        The automatic sample is a bit trickier to explain. The calculator needs to be able to figure
        out the ratio of the denominations without the user giving it a sample. To do this, it
        assumes that all amounts of change recieved back from a financial transaction, modulo the
        value of the smallest denomination of bill, are equally likely.
    </p>
    <p>
        To see why this might be
        a reasonable assumption, imagine some arbitary continuous probability distribution. Then cut it into equally
        sized slices, where the width, δ, of a slice is much smaller than the width of the distribution.
        Importantly, the variation of the distribution within each slice should be negligible.
        Then create a second distribution defined between zero and δ. The probability density at some value x
        in this second distribution is equal to the sum of the probability density in each slice
        of the first distribution at a distance x from the left edge of the slice.
        Because the variation of the first distribution is negligible within each slice, we can treat them as a collection
        of constant distributions. The sum of constant distributions must be a constant distribution.
        What this means in terms of the calculator is that if the vast majority of transactions involve the exchange of values larger
        than the value of the smallest denomination of bill (δ), and if the difference between the price of something,
        and the money given for payment is "random enough", then all amounts of change recieved back from a financial transaction,
        modulo the value of the smallest denomination of bill (δ), are equally likely.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next assumption is that change will always be given using the smallest number of coins possible.
        This is standard practice in most of world.
        The third and final assumption is that people are not selectively using coins of one denomination while ignore coins
        of other denominations. For example, in the United States, Quarters (25¢) are accepted by many automatic payment
        machines, while other denominations are generally not accepted. The third assumption utilizes the idea that coins
        that end up in spare change jars generally aren't being used to pay for things, and are therefore immune to any selective
        usage effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        With these assumptions, it is possible to iterate over all values less then the value of the smallest denomination of
        bill. And, at each value, determine how to represent the value using the smallest number of coins possible.
        Through this process, one can keep track of how many times each denomination is used.
        The collection of coins used throughout this iteration becomes the sample.
        This sample can then be treated identially to a user-provided sample, as if we were using
        the manual sample option.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Important notes:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
            When computing the minimum value of the range, it is assumed that the jar contains only
            the coin with the lowest value per gram and that the weight was overestimated by 10%.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            When computing the maximum value of the range, it is assumed that the jar contains only
            the coin with the highest value per gram and that the weight was underestimated by 10%.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The automatic sample will work correctly for all the currencies
            listed, except the Indian Rupee where it will overestimate the number of ₹10 coins.
        </p>
        <p>
            The automatic sample only works if, within a currency, no bill and coin share a value.
            Several currencies included in this program violate this assumption, however, in most of these cases
            there is a strong enough preference for the bill or the coin that the other can be ignored.
            Two currencies violate this without a strong preference for either bill or coin.
            The Chiniese Renminbi has a bill equivilent for each coin. It is assumed that
            as long as each set of change received uses only the bill form or only the coin form, and that the decision of
            which to use is not influenced by the values involved, then the bills with coin value can be safely ignored.
            The other currency is the Indian Rupee. The ₹10 bill and the ₹10 coin both have wide enough circulation that neither
            can be ignored. And, unlike the Chinese Renminbi, we cannot assume that change is received entirely as bills
            or coins. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            In all but one case, the weight of the coins was determined from publically available
            information on government mint websites.
            The People's Bank of China does not publically release information about the Chinese Renminbi.
            For this case, the weight of each denomination was determined by comparing values listed on
            coin auction websites. The weights for the Chiniese Renminbi used by this program should be accurate
            to within 2, maybe 3, significant figures, on par with the information available for other currencies.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The decision of which currencies to include was not political in nature.
            Those currencies included are those with the largest global circulation.
            Some currencies which should have been included under this criterion were
            ommited because determining the weight of each denomination of coin proved
            to be too difficult. If you wish to include another currency, please create
            a pull request <a href="https://github.com/coin-jar-value/coin-jar-value.github.io">here</a>,
            providing a source for the weights of the coins in the comments.
